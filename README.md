# Hand Gesture Controlled Ping Pong
The Hand Gesture Controlled Ping Pong Game is a fun and interactive project that allows you to control a ping pong game using hand gestures. In this project, a slider will be moved to and fro based on your hand gestures, and the movement of the slider will determine the movement of the ping pong ball within the game.
